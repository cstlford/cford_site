# 🧠 Castle Ford — Portfolio & Projects

This is my personal website, built to showcase my work, technical skills, and product thinking as a software engineer. It features selected projects, a detailed resume section, and a bit about me — including my interests in frontend development, generative AI, and startup culture.

## 🌐 Tech Stack

- **React** (w/ TypeScript)
- **Vite** for fast build tooling
- **Styled with** custom CSS

## 💼 Features

- Clean, responsive layout built from scratch
- Project previews with links and descriptions
- Embedded resume section rendered as HTML
- About page to give a sense of who I am beyond the code
- Contact section with links and location

## 🚀 Goals

This site isn’t just a portfolio — it reflects how I approach software: purposeful, iterative, and user-centered. I'm always adding new projects and experimenting with ways to communicate both my code and my thought process more effectively.
